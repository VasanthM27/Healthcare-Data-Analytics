# Healthcare Analytics Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing patient data to extract key insights and improve healthcare operations. The dataset includes various attributes such as patient demographics, satisfaction scores, wait times, and department referrals. By using Power BI for data visualization and DAX queries for analysis, this project aims to provide actionable insights to optimize patient management and enhance overall satisfaction.

## Programming Languages and Tools Used
- **Power BI** (Data Modeling, DAX Queries)
- **Excel** (Data Transformation)
- **DAX Queries**

## Project Benefits
- **Improved patient management** through identification of key trends such as patient satisfaction and average wait times.
- **Actionable insights for resource allocation** based on patient data analysis (e.g., administrative privileges and patient wait times).
- **Visual representation** of healthcare metrics to aid stakeholders in decision-making.
  
## Project Steps

### Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Imported raw patient data into **Power BI** for analysis.
- Cleaned and transformed data in **Excel** to ensure consistency and accuracy before loading it into Power BI.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Analysis
- **Measure 1**: Total number of patients over time.
- **Measure 2**: Percentage of patients with and without administrative privileges.
- **Measure 3**: Analysis of patients without administrative privileges.
- **Measure 4**: Average satisfaction score (excluding blanks).
- **Measure 5**: Overall average satisfaction score for all patients.
- **Measure 6**: Average patient wait time.

### Insights and Analysis
1. **Patient Count Analysis**  
   The total number of patients is tracked over time to analyze trends, patient flow, and overall hospital traffic.
   
2. **Administrative Privilege Breakdown**  
   Analyzed how many patients have administrative privileges, providing a comparison between those with and without scheduling access, helping in resource allocation decisions.

3. **Patient Satisfaction Analysis**  
   Calculated the **average satisfaction score**, excluding blank entries, and provided overall insights into patient experiences. This highlights areas needing improvement to boost patient satisfaction.
   
4. **Wait Time Analysis**  
   The average wait time was calculated to provide insights into patient experience and efficiency of hospital departments.

### Final Power BI Dashboard Report
A fully interactive **Power BI dashboard** was developed to showcase key findings, including:
- Patient distribution across demographics.
- Insights into administrative privileges.
- Satisfaction scores and trends.
- Average wait times by department.

## DAX Queries Used
- **Measure 1**: Total patients over time.
- **Measure 2**: Percentage of patients with and without administrative privileges.
- **Measure 3**: Patients without administrative privileges.
- **Measure 4 & 5**: Average satisfaction scores (excluding blanks).
- **Measure 6**: Average wait time.
